# Overview

In order to increase my abilities as a programmer, I decided to take a foray into the Kotlin language.

This program is a game of Hangman. It uses classes (written in Kotlin) to represent 1) the word the user is trying to guess, and 2) a man and how many guesses the user has left. I enabled replay functionality, where if the user wanted to play Hangman again, they wouldn't need to run the program every time.

This program is meant to be a demonstration of what I have learned about Kotlin and how to use it after knowing nothing of it beforehand.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

For this project, I used JetRider's IntelliJ program as the text editor and JDK.

To make this program, I used the Kotlin language and the java.util.{Scanner/Random} libraries from Java.

# Future Work
- Add a function that will ensure the program won't crash if the user enters any number of characters other than one (not including whitespace).
